-- We can define the following:
-- x = 1 : (map (1+) x )
-- and then evaluate take 5 x.
-- One might think that in fact the following happens:
-- take 5 x
-- = take 5 (1:2:map (+1) x)
-- = take 5 (1:2:map (+1) [1, 2 ])
-- = take 5 (1:2:2:3: map (+1) x)
-- = take 5 (1:2:2:3: map (+1) [1, 2, 2, 3])
-- = take 5 (1:2:2:3: 2:3:3:4: map (+1) x)
-- Explain precisely why this is wrong. Saying that ”That is because the Haskell interpreter gives
-- a different result” is not a valid answer – you have to provide an evaluation sequence as the ones
-- presented in the text for today.


{-
x is an infinite list, where:

- The first element is 1.
- The rest of the list (tail x) is generated by mapping the function (1 +) over the list x itself.

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]


The take function requests the first 5 elements of x. Haskell evaluates x lazily, calculating only what is needed.

Substituting this into take 5 x:
take 5 (1 : (map (1+) x))

Extracting the first element: The take function extracts the first element (1) and then recursively takes 4 more elements from the tail of the list:
1 : take 4 (map (1+) x)

Evaluating map (1+) x: The map function applies (1 +) to each element of x. Since x = 1 : (map (1+) x), the result of map (1+) x is:
map (1+) x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]

Substituting this:
1 : take 4 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]

Continuing take: The take function extracts the next 4 elements:
1 : [2, 3, 4, 5]

Thus, the result of take 5 x is:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
